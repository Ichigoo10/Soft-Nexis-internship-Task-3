Task 3 – Time Series Analysis

This task focuses on Time Series Analysis (TSA) as part of the Data Science Using Python Internship.
Time series analysis helps identify patterns, trends, and seasonal variations in data recorded over time and supports accurate forecasting for future periods.

The dataset used for this task is AirPassengers.csv, containing monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960. It is well-suited for studying long-term growth and repeating seasonal patterns.

Objective

The key objectives of this task were to:

Understand and visualize trend and seasonal components in time-based data.

Apply smoothing techniques to highlight long-term movement.

Build and evaluate a forecasting model to predict future values.

Derive business insights from historical patterns.

Process Summary

The dataset was explored and prepared for analysis by converting date columns into a proper time index.
Using seasonal decomposition, the data was separated into trend, seasonality, and residual components, revealing a steady upward trajectory and a clear yearly cycle.
Moving averages (6-month and 12-month) were applied to smooth fluctuations and confirm the overall upward trend.
An ARIMA model was then implemented to forecast future passenger numbers, achieving high accuracy with minimal prediction error.

Insights and Findings

Passenger traffic showed a consistent 12 % annual growth rate.

Seasonality was evident, with peaks around July–August and dips in February–March.

Forecasts for 1961 projected an average of 550–600 passengers per month.

Airlines could use these insights to plan capacity expansion during high-demand seasons.

Skills Demonstrated

✅ Time-Series Analysis and Visualization
✅ Trend and Seasonality Decomposition
✅ Forecasting with ARIMA
✅ Performance Evaluation and Interpretation

Outcome

This task enhanced understanding of time-based data behavior and predictive modeling.
By combining trend analysis, decomposition, and ARIMA forecasting, it provided meaningful insights into growth patterns and seasonal demand, forming a strong base for data-driven decision-making in business forecasting.
